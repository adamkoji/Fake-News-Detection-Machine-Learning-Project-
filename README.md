# Fake-News-Detection-Machine-Learning-Project-
-This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset containing labeled fake and true news articles to train various classification algorithms. The trained models are deployed using Flask, allowing users to input news articles and receive predictions on their authenticity.

-Features:
  1.Utilizes labeled dataset of fake and true news articles.
  2.Implements algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
  3.Uses TF-IDF vectorization for text data preprocessing.
  4.Provides a web interface via Flask for user interaction.
  5.Displays predictions for input news articles.

-Usage:
  1.Enter a news article into the input field.
  2.Click the "Submit" button to receive predictions on the article's authenticity.
  3.View the predictions displayed on the webpage.
